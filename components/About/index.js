        <p className="about__title">a bit more about me</p>
        <h3>I'm a digital designer and developer based in Boston and focused on design systems, accessibility, reactive interfaces and data-driven applications.</h3>
        <p>Most recently I obtained my master's degree in digital design after many moons of being a practitioner of the user experience craft. Not done with that, I've decided to pursue a master's in data science with the goal of working on intelligent navigation frameworks for hardware applications.</p>
        <p>I've been lucky enough to work on a number of exciting projects with very talented people in various industries over the years. This has afforded me a tremendous amount of insight into the real requirements of planning, designing, developing and deploying modern web-based applications. Finding a great solution for every problem is still an exciting challenge while I continue to learn from my experiences and those of the people I work with.</p>
        <p>I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my knowledge and experience and learn while working on projects, big or small, that make use of technology for the greater good.</p>
